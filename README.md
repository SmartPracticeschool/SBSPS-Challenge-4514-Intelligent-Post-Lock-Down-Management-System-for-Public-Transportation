An app or message-based notification system for informing people, when the seating capacity of a particular mode of transport, gets completely filled up.
Maintaining a specified number of seats for emergency passengers in buses and metros, in case an urgent situation arises, and making their bookings available in a smart and interactive way.
Notification based system to prevent masses from over-lodging into escalators or similar places.
A readdress system for reporting convicted un-sanitized public places or people not following norms.
A smart-route prediction system working on past traffic movement records, to foretell a better path.
A Perimeter Alarm System for safeguarding oneself from people coming too close
A ground breaking free-lancing backed delivery system to enable easy delivery of goods and commodities.
A system for reporting people intuited of having contracted the virus, for the general public.
A smart alert system to indicate it’s users, excessive crowd accumulation, at a particular spot on their route, showing a prescribed speed for them to travel to allow the traffic clear-up before they reach that particular spot, in times another route to the destination is not available. (Leveraging sound-based technology for two-wheelers)
Predicting the least huddled shops and facilities en route a journey to people.
Analyzing past records and showing the least taken mode of travel to people going from a particular place to a particular place.

## Novelty/ Uniqueness-
A single web-based app , launched, to tackle the several different problems arising post lockdown lifting, keeping in view the social distancing norms. Our presented application addresses issues right from national-level movement to inter-city level motion. It provides solutions from every individual aspect, one can think of. Below are some points to show it’s uniqueness-
Bordering out the virus hit places on maps would help people take precautions before-hand.
Buses and metros can preset a definite number of seats respectively for helping passengers follow social distancing norms inside them.
A pre-kept number of seats for emergency travelers would make sure people do not lose out on anything in times of urgency.
Capturing location data from travelers and analyzing them to find out the best possible route and mode of transport together with the real-time data would make sure, the system is efficient and proven.
Sound-based navigation would help two-wheelers stay protected by showing them the best route to their destination.
A system for reporting COVID suspected people would help in the betterment of them as well as the general public.
A perimeter alarm system would see that no two people come so close that the chances of the virus getting spread from the infected to the fit person get high.
Limiting the number of interactions would make sure everything remains under control.
Free-lanced system for goods delivery would help both the parties.

## Business/ Social Impact-
While developing any application, it is important to make sure that it has a social as well as a business impact. Our solution too is aspired to have command in these two fronts, in the below mentioned following ways-
Post Lockdown lifting, it may become difficult for people to continue staying contained inside their homes as they are now. Our application would make sure that people are able to easily commute to their favorite destinations, and follow the basic social distancing norms at the same time, thereby helping serve them while also they are being protected.
Businesses impacted due to the unavailability of proper routes through safety, to people, would be able to function unanimously all over again.

The emergency feature would help fellow volunteers earn some money at the same time as the other person gets helped.
A proper rewarding system would help people report suspected COVID contracted cases more easily leading to a safer environment for everyone tomorrow.


## Technology Stack-
Currently, we have planned to build a mobile as well as a web application for which we plan to use the MERN stack to develop the front end and backend, additionally, if features demand better use then use of Django or Flask framework can be used with a suitable and simple user-friendly frontend for ease of access. For predicting the crowds and best routes we plan to use the GPS and GPRS data to fetch location details of users with mobile phones to predict the gathering of the crowd at any particular location. For deploying and transparent usage of the application we plan to use IBM Cloud deployment infrastructure. For all the scripting and processing stuff, we aim to use Python 3 for the operations. We also aim to build an interactive support system using the IBM Watson assistant and also using the various tools of the IBM Watson Studio for implementing the predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms as and when required.

## Scope of Work-
Later we aim to add an extended feature for the application users’ to record from their responses the worst-hit businesses to draw out a common conclusion depicting the severity of the impact the virus had on different professions.
